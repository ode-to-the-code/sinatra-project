<!-- trying to build out the signup

in the browser, i got a strange error saying 'Errno::ENOENT: no such file or
directory'. These are apparently a class of errors, described as part
of the 'error hierarchy' which is a classification system for ruby errors,
which act as a kind of adapter between the operating system and ruby's exception
system.

Anyway  -->
